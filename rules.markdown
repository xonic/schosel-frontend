## Price Money
The pot equals the sum of all players participation fees. It will be fully paid out to the best players. If you bet on the right outcome of matches and the final cup winner you collect points for each of the 4 categories. Each category is worth **25%** of the entire pot. If you make it to the top 3 of the score list in a category you win some cash. Here's what's in for you:

  1. First place **60%** (**15%** of the pot)
  2. Second place **30%** (**7.5%** of the pot)
  3. Third place **10%** (**2.5%** of the pot)

So if you land on first place in one category and get third in another, you get 17.5% of the entire pot. Assuming there are 50 players that would make you 87.5â‚¬ richer!

## Betting
You bet on the outcome of **all 64 world cup matches** as well as on the final cup winner. For each correct bet you collect points based on automatically calculated odds.

* **During the whole tournament** you can place **8 super bets** which double the points you get if your bet is correct.
* You can **only place and change your final cup winner bet until the first match begins**.
* Match bets on the match outcome (Team 1 wins/Draw/Team 2 wins) can be placed and changed until the match itself begins.
* Bets are made for the final outcome of the game **before a potential penalty shootout**.

---

## Odds
Odds determine the **amount of points you get for each correct bet**. If many players place the same bet they get less points. In case only few players place the same bet they are rewarded with more points. Odds only become visible after the match started and no player can change their bet anymore.

### Odd calculation
Odds are calculated according this simple equation:

**Odds = total number of players / number of players with same bet**

So if you want to get more points, try to place a different bet than the other players. Odds apply to bets on matches as well as the final cup winner.

### Example

* Let's assume there are **50** players in total.
* **15** players bet on a win for team 1. The odds equal **50 / 15 = 3.33** points.
* **30** players bet on outcome X (draw). The odds equal **50 / 30 = 1.67** points.
* **5** players bet on a win for team 2. The odds equal **50 / 5 = 10** points.

Let's further assume that the match results in a draw after 120 minutes. Team 1 wins after a penalty shootout. This is still counted as draw and the 30 players who bet on draw will each get 1.67 points. All other players will get 0 points.

The points for the correct cup winner bet are calculated the same way. So if for example only 2 people guess the final cup winner, they each get 50 / 2 = 25 points.

## Goals
In the past players often stopped betting during later cup stages when they realised they couldn't get to the first three ranks in the score table anymore. This is why we decided to introduce new categories that you can win even if you have a low overall score. You compete with the other players for the highest rank in each category. 

### The Schosel
You earn points from correct bets in this category.
For example:

* Germany plays Switzerland
* Odds result in Germany 1.5, Draw 2.5, Switzerland 10
* You bet on Switzerland
* Switzerland wins
* You get 10 points

### Loser
You earn points from wrong bets in this category.
For example:

* Germany plays Switzerland
* Odds result in Germany 1.5, Draw 2.5, Switzerland 10
* You bet on Germany
* Switzerland wins
* You get 1.5 points
* If you bet on a draw, you would have gotten 2.5 points

### Underdog
You earn points from correct bets on the highest odds.
For example:

* Germany plays Switzerland
* Odds result in Germany 1.5, Draw 2.5, Switzerland 10
* You bet on Switzerland
* Switzerland wins
* You get 10 points


### Secret
There is one secret extra that will be revealed after the final match. Until then players can only see their ranking for this extra but they don't know how it's calculated. The organizers of Schosel know the extra and are therefore excluded so they can't win this extra.
